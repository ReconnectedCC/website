    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
    Effective September 01, 2024.

This privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) describes how the ReconnectedCC Team, operating as ReconnectedCC (“RCC,” “we,” or “us”) collects, uses and discloses personal information (“Personal Information”) about you when you visit any of the websites owned or operated by ReconnectedCC (collectively, the “Sites”), connect to any of our Minecraft servers (collectively, the “Servers”), or when you otherwise interact with us.

Other websites and providers may follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the information you submit to them, such as third-party mods included installed on your client or provided by us in our modpack, or the platform you may use to communicate with us such as Discord. We encourage you to read the privacy policies or statements of other websites you visit before providing your information to them.

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make substantial changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of this Privacy Policy and adding a notice to the #announcements channel in our Discord server. If you use the Servers after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all the changes.

Lawful Basis - for our European Users only
For our users based in the UK and the European Economic Area ("EEA"), the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") (as applicable in either the UK or the EEA) will apply to our processing of your personal data. We always ensure that we have a "lawful basis" under GDPR for processing your personal data. This means we have a legitimate reason recognized by the GDPR for processing your information and using it as we have set out in this Privacy Policy. Our lawful basis will be as follows:
    for the purpose of our contract with you and so that we can provide, manage, maintain and secure the Servers you request;
    to fulfil our legitimate interest to operate and improve our business, including to administer, protect, and improve our Sites, Servers and our systems, to develop new products and services, and for other internal business purposes; and
    to fulfil our legitimate interest to better understand the preferences of the users of our Servers, compile aggregated statistics about usage of our Servers, and help improve your experience of our website and Servers.

How We Share Your Personal Information
We never share your Personal Information without your permission where a level of privacy is expected. However, the Personal Information you provide to our Servers or communication platforms in public channels may be publicly visible to others using the Servers or platforms. This information is not protected by this Privacy Policy as no level of privacy is expected in such cases. Visitors may be able to see certain Personal Information about you such as your username, profile picture, and other information you’ve provided to the platform on your profile.
Vendors and Service Providers: We may share your Personal Information with vendors, consultants and other service providers who need access to such information to help us with our business activities, perform work or provide services on our behalf.

If you would like to exercise any of these rights, please contact us at privacy@reconnected.cc.

Retention
We don't want to hold on to any of your Personal Data for longer than we need to. We delete your Personal Data as soon as we no longer require it to provide our Sites and Servers unless there is a legal obligation we are subject to which requires us to hold onto it.
