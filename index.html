        <b>Effective September 01, 2024.</b>
        <p>This privacy policy (the “<b>Privacy Policy</b>”) describes how the ReconnectedCC Team, operating as
            ReconnectedCC
            (“<b>RCC</b>,” “<b>we</b>,” or “<b>us</b>”) collects, uses and discloses personal information (“<b>Personal
                Information</b>”) about you
            when you visit any of the websites owned or operated by ReconnectedCC (collectively, the “<b>Sites</b>”),
            connect
            to any of our Minecraft servers (collectively, the “<b>Servers</b>”), or when you otherwise interact with
            us.</p>
        <p>Other websites and providers may follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of the information
            you submit to them, such as third-party mods included installed on your client or provided by us in our
            modpack, or the platform you may use to communicate with us such as Discord. We encourage you to read the
            privacy policies or statements of other websites you visit before providing your information to them.</p>
        <p>We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make substantial changes, we will notify you by
            revising the date at the top of this Privacy Policy and adding a notice to the #announcements channel in our
            Discord server. If you use the Servers after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means

            believe that a child under 13 may have provided us Personal Information, please contact us at
